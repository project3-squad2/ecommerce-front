## Project Idea

What is your project idea?

Monster for hire.  We created a e-commerce application that was aimed at helping

the opportunity for parents to hire monsters to scare their children into being
well-behaved members of society.

How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

We wanted to do something fun and different.  Obviously it is fictional, so it is
